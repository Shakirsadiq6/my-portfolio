# Django Portfolio Project

This is a Django-based portfolio project that showcases my personal and professional achievements, skills, and projects. It serves as a centralized platform to present my work to potential clients, employers, or collaborators.

## Features

- **About Me**: A section that provides an overview of myself, including my background, education, and interests.
- **Skills**: A list of my skills and competencies, presented in a visually appealing manner.
- **Projects**: A gallery of my completed projects, including descriptions, images, and links to live demos or repositories.
- **Contact**: A contact form that allows visitors to get in touch with me directly.
- **Chatbot**: A custom trained chatbot with the domain of GPT.
- **Translater**: A language translator to navigate into the website in any language.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shakirsadiq6/my-portfolio.git
cd my-portfolio
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser account (to access the admin panel):

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The portfolio should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Usage

### Admin Panel

To access the admin panel, go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in using the superuser account credentials. From the admin panel, you can manage projects, update skills, and edit other content on the website.

### Updating Content

- To update your personal information, navigate to the `about` app and modify the relevant templates and views.
- To add or update projects, use the admin panel or modify the project-related templates and views in the `projects` app.
- To update your skills, use the admin panel or modify the skill-related templates and views in the `skills` app.
- The contact form is already functional, and messages will be sent to the email associated with the admin account.

## Customization

You can easily customize this portfolio project to fit your personal preferences and style. You can modify the templates, CSS styles, and add more functionalities to the website as needed.

## Deployment

Before deploying this project to a production environment, it is recommended to follow Django's deployment best practices. Some of the steps include:

- Updating the `SECRET_KEY` in `settings.py` with a strong secret key.
- Configuring the database settings appropriately for the production environment.
- Using a production-ready web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
- Collecting static files and serving them using a web server or a content delivery network (CDN).
- Configuring email settings for contact form functionality.
